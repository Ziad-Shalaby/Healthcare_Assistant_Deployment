# Healthcare Assistant Deployment

This project provides a Streamlit application for a healthcare assistant, leveraging NLP models for various tasks.

## Description

This Streamlit application aims to assist users with healthcare-related information in an intuitive and accessible way. By employing natural language processing (NLP) models, the assistant can understand and respond to user queries expressed in natural language, rather than requiring specific keywords or commands. The goal is to create a helpful tool for users seeking information, guidance, or support related to health and well-being.

The backend of the application is thoughtfully structured to separate different aspects of its functionality. This modular design enhances maintainability, scalability, and the overall robustness of the system.

## Key Features (Potential)

Based on the project structure, the Healthcare Assistant might offer features such as:

* **Question Answering:** Answering user questions related to medical conditions, symptoms, treatments, medications, and general health inquiries.
* **Information Retrieval:** Providing relevant information from a knowledge base or through API calls to medical resources.
* **Symptom Checking:** Potentially assisting users in understanding possible causes of their symptoms (note: this should always be accompanied by a disclaimer advising professional medical consultation).
* **Medication Information:** Offering details about medications, including usage, side effects, and interactions (with appropriate disclaimers).
* **Appointment Scheduling (Future):** Integration with scheduling systems to help users book appointments with healthcare providers.
* **Personalized Recommendations (Future):** Based on user history and provided information, offering tailored health and wellness advice (with appropriate disclaimers).
* **Question Generation:** The `api_utils.py` suggests the capability to generate relevant follow-up questions to guide the user or gather more context.

**It's important to note that the actual implemented features will depend on the specific NLP models and data integrated into the application.**

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for the entire project.
* **Streamlit:** A Python library for creating interactive web applications from Python scripts, used for building the user interface.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** Likely utilizes libraries such as:
    * **Transformers (Hugging Face):** For pre-trained language models and related utilities.
    * **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy:** For text preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
* **API Interactions:** The `api_utils.py` indicates the use of APIs, which could involve libraries like `requests` for making HTTP calls. The specific APIs used would depend on the functionalities implemented (e.g., medical knowledge APIs, search APIs).
* **Potentially other libraries:** Depending on the specific NLP tasks and model implementations (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).

## Code Structure Breakdown

* **`app.py`**: This script is the entry point of the application. It defines the user interface elements using Streamlit and orchestrates the flow of information. It takes user input, sends it to the backend for processing, and displays the results.
* **`model_utils.py`**: This module handles the loading of the pre-trained NLP models from the `models/` directory. It likely contains functions that take processed text as input and use the loaded models to generate predictions or responses.
* **`api_utils.py`**: This file contains functions responsible for interacting with external APIs. For instance, it might have functions to send a user's query to a question generation API and retrieve relevant follow-up questions.
* **`preprocess_utils.py`**: This module provides a set of utility functions for cleaning and preparing text data before it's fed into the NLP models. This can include steps like removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
* **`tokenizer/`**: This directory houses the tokenizer files. Tokenizers are crucial for converting text into a sequence of tokens (words or sub-words) that the NLP models can understand. Different models often require specific tokenization methods and vocabularies.
* **`models/`**: This directory contains the saved weights and configurations of the trained NLP models. These models are the core of the assistant's ability to understand and generate text.
* **`requirements.txt`**: This file ensures that anyone setting up the project can easily install all the necessary Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Healthcare_Assistant_Deployment
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

This command will launch the healthcare assistant application in your web browser. You can then interact with the assistant by typing your questions or requests into the provided interface.
