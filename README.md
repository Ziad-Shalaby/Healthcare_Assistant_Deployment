## Project Overview
This Streamlit application aims to assist users with healthcare-related information in an intuitive and accessible way. By employing natural language processing (NLP) models, the assistant can understand and respond to user inputs, simulating a virtual consultation. The backend is structured to separate different aspects of its functionality, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Dataset
The application utilizes multiple healthcare-related datasets, each containing symptom and disease mappings. These datasets are preprocessed and tailored for specific models, including:
- BiLSTM Neural Networks
- Traditional Machine Learning Classifiers
- Ensemble Learning Models

### Data Preprocessing
- Custom tokenization
- Feature engineering
- Data cleaning and normalization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ziad-Shalaby/Healthcare_Assistant_Deployment.git
   cd Healthcare_Assistant_Deployment
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Interaction Flow
1. The assistant initiates with an initial symptom inquiry
2. Asks a series of follow-up questions based on user responses
3. Processes input through multiple machine learning models
4. Provides a prediction based on ensemble voting mechanism
